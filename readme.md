# `Baza Vje≈æbi` - A vanilla.js example application

An experimental application to demonstrate what is it like to write ES5-ish JavaScript code without an external npm library, view engine libraries and without babel or TypeScript transpilers.

## What does the app do

The application itself is a database of workout categories with their assigned exercises. A sort of TODO application that has some state, logic, persistance (localStorage) and validation to it.

## i18n caveat

The app UI is in Croatian language (except footer), so is some HTML with the accompanying CSS. JavaScript source is in English language.
